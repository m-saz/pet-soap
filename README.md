# Pet-SOAP
SOAP service and client. Built using **Spring Web Services** exposing endpoints and producing dynamic WSDL definition, domain classes generated by **JAXB**, domain to entity/model mapping by **MapStruct**, persistence with **Spring Data JPA**, **Hibernate**, **PostgreSQL** and client views generated with **Thymeleaf**.

Run service and database with `docker-compose build && docker-compose up`

After service is up, run client with `client.sh`. Client build process requires access to published WSDL, so it won't compile if service is down.

WSDL file can be accessed at http://localhost:8080/ws/owners.wsdl

Client is at http://localhost:8081/

TO DO:
- Client form validation
- Tests
